### Application Description

This is a simple, but fully functioning web-based application created to mimic a book e-commerce website. This project used advanced Java/JSP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL concepts to create a dynamic hotel room booking website for a faux hotel chain named Provisio Hotels. The application allows users to view the About Us and Provisio Locations pages without being a registered user, but if users want to check room availability, book a reservation, or lookup a previous reservation, a guard filter ensures they must first register or login. Once logged in, users may choose their vacation specifications in order to book mock hotel reservations and data like user information and reservation history is securely stored in a MySQL database for future access. The application features security-conscious techniques like password encryption + salt, input sanitization, password hashing, responsive front-end design, exception handling, session tracking, and the MVC architecture.
